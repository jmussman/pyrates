# Pyrates - Branding

## Introduction

Workforce users expect to see Okta stuff, after all they have
been indoctrinated into the Okta dashboard, it sill is a good idea to
configure the logos and stuff they see to match the real organization.

Customers do not expect to see anything about Okta, from their point of
view they are working only with the business or organization.
Branding it all away is a must, and that is what we are going to address here
because you can do the same thing for workforce too!
